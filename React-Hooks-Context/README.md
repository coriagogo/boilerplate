# REACT HOOKS & CONTEXT API BOILERPLATE (CONFLUX)

This directory contains boilerplate for React hooks and the Context API to make your life easier in starting a new React application with clean, elegant state management.

The patterns contained in this repository are the predecessor to those from the [Conflux](https://github.com/dustinmyers/react-conflux) state management library that [Dustin Myers](https://github.com/dustinmyers) and I built. It's currently hosted on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-conflux) and available for download.

## GETTING STARTED

- Fork or clone repository
- Use `yarn create react-app <name>` to create new application
- Install these dependencies using `yarn add`:
  - `react-router`
  - `react-router-dom`
- Copy over boilerplate files to get started with React Hooks and Context API
