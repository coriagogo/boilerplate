## NOTES

As this is my personal collection of boilerplate, it is (by it's very nature) opinionated. Each of us codes in a slightly different way, and everyone has their own preferred method of writing it; while there are many ways to write clean and elegant code, these boilerplate files are the way I currently like to structure mine. That does not mean that you're wrong in your approach. On the contrary, I hope that you can take what you see here, adapt it to your own style, and then make something completely and incredibly new out of it.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

- [Frank Faustino](https://github.com/frankfaustino) - Thanks for paving the way and inspiring both me and future generations of Lambda School students to reach higher than they would have otherwise. I saw your boilerplate library and thought it was awesome, so I decided to make my own.
